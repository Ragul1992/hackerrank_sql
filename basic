1)Query all columns for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 100000. The CountryCode for America is USA.

The CITY table is described as follows:

Select * FROM city where countrycode = 'USA' AND POPULATION > 100000 ;

2)Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:

SOL 1:
SELECT CITY, LEN(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LEN(CITY) OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY ;
SELECT CITY, LEN(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LEN(CITY) DESC OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY  ;

SOL 2:
SELECT TOP(1) CITY, LEN(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LEN(CITY);
SELECT TOP(1)CITY, LEN(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LEN(CITY) DESC;
